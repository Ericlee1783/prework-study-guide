# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The key motivation for me was to switch out of my current career and to pursue the tech industry. I had no knowledge about coding and the different types of careers one can pursue with coding so to take this prework and trying to learn a little by little helped me to further motivate myself. I built this project because I wanted to get a better understanding of how much one can do with coding and seeing myself builidng this small website helped me to realize that it takes a lot of time and effort to make a website fully functional. This website solves the issue of trying to study for everything I have and or will learn throughout the bootcamp and referring back to it whenever I need it. I learned through this short prework that coding isn't a easy skill and that everything requires much effort and time. One typo can lead to the whole code not being able to function and I can already see myself missing a letter on a code and trying to find it to make the code functional.

## Usage

This small website contains notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git which are the topics that this prework had covered. Although it was just concepts of how each languages worked, I got to see a little of each to see how each of them worked and how they all work together as well.
